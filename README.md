# CS-255-Project-2-
This project was about the client DriverPass. They wanted a system that enabled users to be able to take DMV courses and driving lessons. They required both a business requirements and all the system requirements that went into creating the system. Above you will find both. 

I feel what I did well was to keep it simple. I try and keep things as simple as possible, when applicable, to ensure that anyone looking at my work can on some level understand the concept of what I am attempting to do. 

I would revise my use-case diagram. I feel that I may have been a little to simple and that there were things that I could of potentially added. 

I interpreted the users needs by reading the transcript of the clients meeting over and over again throughout the course to make sure that I was aware of all the things that were required of my overall design. It is very important to take into account the users needs because if all needs aren't met then the system's design won't ultimately be the best that it could be. 

I approach designing software by first taking really good notes of the requirements. I feel that helps me in the long-run and makes things much easier. Also, when creating diagrams, I first make a rough draft on paper of what I want the diagram to look like and how I want it to function. This gives me a visualization of the steps needed when making the final draft. I try and be as consistent as possible with my designs and taking good notes and drawing my diagrams helps immensely.
